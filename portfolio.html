                    I’ve spent most of my career exploring the intersection of computer graphics, performance engineering, and immersive technology.<br/>
                    Early on, I found joy in not only solving technical problems but also in sharing what I learned, which led me to write books and articles like The Graphics Programming Black Book. Explaining complex topics in a way that others could use has always been as rewarding to me as the engineering work itself.
                    Over the years, I’ve had the chance to contribute to projects that pushed the limits of what computers could do in games, operating systems, and now virtual reality.<br/>
                    Whether working close to the hardware, helping optimize performance, or exploring the future of VR and AR, I’ve tried to focus on building foundations that others can build upon.

                <h3 class="projects">Quake</h3>
                <p class="sec-paragraph">At id Software, I worked alongside John Carmack and the team on Quake. My focus was on performance and graphics optimization — making it possible to render fully 3D environments in real time on the PCs of the mid-1990s. It was a challenging project, but also exciting to help bring something new into the world that influenced how 3D games were made going forward.</p>

                <h3 class="projects">Windows NT & Intel</h3>
                <p class="sec-paragraph">Later, at Microsoft, I worked on Windows NT with an emphasis on performance. That experience deepened my understanding of system-level engineering. At Intel, I continued in a similar direction by helping to develop tools for analyzing and optimizing code performance. These tools gave developers a clearer picture of how software interacts with modern CPUs and how to get the most out of the hardware.</p>

                <h3 class="projects">Valve VR Research</h3>
                <p class="sec-paragraph">When I joined Valve, I shifted focus toward virtual reality. Our small research team explored ways to reduce latency, improve tracking, and create more natural VR experiences. Many of the insights from that work eventually fed into consumer VR systems like the HTC Vive, and it was rewarding to see how research translated into real products people could use.</p>

                <h3 class="projects">Oculus / Meta Reality Labs</h3>
                <p class="sec-paragraph">Since 2014, I’ve been Chief Scientist at Oculus, now part of Meta’s Reality Labs. My role is to help guide long-term research into VR and AR — areas like advanced optics, eye-tracking, hand-tracking, and foveated rendering. The goal has been not just to make the technology work, but to make immersive computing feel natural and useful in everyday life.</p>
