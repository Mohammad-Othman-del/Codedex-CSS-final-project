# Michael Abrash Portfolio (HTML & CSS)

This is a simple personal portfolio webpage built using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
It was created as a learning project to practice semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, layout techniques, and hover/transition effects.

## Design Notes
- The design is intentionally kept simple and minimalistic for learning purposes.  
- No JavaScript was used or allowed â€” all interactions are implemented with pure CSS.  
- Hover effects, transitions, and gradients are used to enhance usability without complexity.  
- The color palette uses dark neutrals with a teal accent for a professional look.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for semantic structure (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, `address`).  
- **CSS3** for layout (Flexbox), hover effects, transitions, gradient masks, and responsive adjustments.
